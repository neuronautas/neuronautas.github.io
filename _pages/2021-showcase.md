The 2021 edition of Neuronautas consisted of two groups of students: the Neurocadetes and the Chimeras. Check out the showcase of their final projects below!

# Neurocadetes

The Neurocadetes adventure lasted 4 weeks and combined neuroscience theory with electronics, robotics, and neuroscience experimental design. Students worked on mini-projects for the first 3 weeks, then spent the last week designing, running, and analysing a final project of their choice.

## Dog, Cats, & Robots

{% include video id="mwsA0s61WmI" provider="youtube" %}

**The Dog, Cats & Robots** group explored how these animals interact with robots. This video, showing one of the cat subjects interacting with a robot, was acquired using the Neuronautas Experimental Kit during one of the experiments.

Students: Inês Beleza Costa, Maria Teresa Leitão, Sofia Manteigas & Miguel Januário.

TAs: João Frazão & André Almeida

## Vulcano Blues

**The Vulcano Blues** group developed a sophisticated experimental set-up to investigate how different audio & visual contexts influence the reaction time of people engaged in a detection task.

Students: Beatriz Robalo & João Lopes.

TAs: João Frazão, Matheus Farias, Danbee Kim & Bruno Cruz.

## Quack Experiment Group

**The Quack Experiment** ventured into the wild of the Gulbenkian Garden in Lisbon to perform three different experiments on ducks. The image above presents a few snapshots from their colour experiment.

Students: Beatriz Quintas, Maria Grilo & Teresa Coimbras.

TAs: Andre Marques & Danbee Kim

## Magic With Dogs

**The Magic With Dogs** group challenged dogs’ ability to tell when they’re being fooled. This image shows how the students applied the programming tool Bonsai to extract key variables from the experimental video.

Students: Rodrigo Sá & Gonçalo Magalhães.

TA: Matheus Farias

## Project 008

{% include video id="iQJ-bssjkYE" provider="youtube" %}

**Project 008** dove into the mysteries of how a young octopus at the Vasco de Gama aquarium in Algés learns.

Students: Margarida Oliveira, Francisca Gonçalves & Maria Pinheiro.

TA: Danbee Kim.

# Chimeras

The Chimeras adventure lasted 2 weeks and combined neuroscience theory with speculative fiction and collective improvisational storytelling. Students spent the first week creating an alien civilization, then spent the second week role-playing as members of this alien civilization.

## World-building

All space vessels are powered by a crystal of adonis, a mineral found only in the ancient home planet of the Chimeras. Portrayed here is the mothership of the agriculture and ecology faction. By: Tiago Cavaco." %}

## Role-playing

It is the year 342 After the Fall (AF). The Chimeran Home Caravan is currently about 14.1 lightyears away from Sol, the solar system that lies at the center of the Human Empire.

The military & exploration faction has recently discovered a planet orbiting a red dwarf star that looks like a very promising candidate for a new Zo-olos. The Council of Elders have reviewed the information from the initial scouting mission, and they agree that this planet is worth exploring further. The Council of Elders wishes to involve all of the factions in this exploration mission, so they made an invitation to all adult Chimeras in every faction to apply to join this exploration mission.

Most Chimerans are very excited and hopeful that this planet could provide a new home for the Chimerans. A small faction of 'loyalists' have been protesting, however, that this new planet does not provide enough ocean to be a true new Zo-olos, and they have been getting increasingly violent. There are concerns that they may sabotage the exploration mission.
