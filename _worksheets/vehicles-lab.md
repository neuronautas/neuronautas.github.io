## Braitenberg Vehicles

## Vehicle 1: Alive

The simplest vehicle. The speed of the motor is directly controlled by a sensor. The impulse is to move always forward, but small perturbations in the terrain will make it restless.

**Components**: 1 sensor, 1 motor.  
**Principle**: The larger the amount of light, heat or sound measured by the sensor, the faster the motor spins.  
**Description**: Alive, restless, dislikes light or heat.

## Vehicle 2a: Cowardly

Two alive vehicles attached to each other. The mechanical coupling between the two vehicles modifies the direction of movement.

**Components**: 2 sensors, 2 motors, each sensor connected to the motor on the same side ("uncrossed").  
**Principle**: The more there is of the quality to which the sensor is tuned, the faster the motors go ("excitatory").  
**Description**: Dislikes the source of the stimulation, tries to run away. If confronted by the light or stimulation source head on, may suddenly try to attack it.

## Vehicle 2b: Aggressive

Crossing or uncrossing the connection between the sensors and the motors modifies the personality of the vehicle.

**Components**: 2 sensors, 2 motors, each sensor connected to the motor on the opposite side ("crossed").  
**Principle**: The more there is of the quality to which the sensor is tuned, the faster the motors go ("excitatory").  
**Description**: Dislikes the source of the stimulation, constantly tries to attack it.

## Vehicle 3a: Loving/Quietly Adoring

The principle connecting the sensors to the motors is reversed. The activation of the sensors now decreases movement.

**Components**: 2 sensors, 2 motors, each sensor connected to the motor on the same side ("uncrossed").  
**Principle**: The more there is of the quality to which the sensor is tuned, the slower the motors go ("inhibitory").  
**Description**: Loves the source, wants to be near it. Comes to rest facing it.

## Vehicle 3b: Loving/Exploring

Crossing or uncrossing the connection between the sensors and the motors modifies the personality of the vehicle.

**Components**: 2 sensors, 2 motors, each sensor connected to the motor on the opposite side ("crossed").  
**Principle**: The more there is of the quality to which the sensor is tuned, the slower the motors go ("inhibitory").  
**Description**: Likes the source, but is easily attracted away.
